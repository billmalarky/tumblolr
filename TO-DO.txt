TO-DO

Security
App is safe from sql injection, but still vulnerable to CSRF and potentially vulnerable to XSS (non-validated data only comes form tumblr api, not sure if tumblr filters content for XSS or outputs non-processed data).

Caching
Would have used redis instead of mySql for data caching. With mysql will have to have some sort of pruning script. Redis could just let data expire.

Create how to edit image page.
