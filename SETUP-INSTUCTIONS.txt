Setup Instructions

Run "vagrant up" in project directory (with vagrant installed).
Note that this vagrant install makes use of symlinks, so in windows 7 you need to run virtualbox and cygwin as an administrator.

//mysql_secure_install and create database as well as import data stuff should be scripted in vagant boostrap

ssh into vagrant.

From the /vagrant directory, run the command
php /usr/local/bin/composer install
