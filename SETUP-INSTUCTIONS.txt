Setup Instructions

Add the following lines to your hosts file:
# Vagrant
192.168.100.100 tumblolr.local
192.168.100.100 www.tumblolr.local

Run "vagrant up" in project directory (with vagrant and vitualbox installed).
Note that this vagrant install makes use of symlinks, so in windows 7 you need to run virtualbox and cygwin as an administrator.
