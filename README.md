Tumblolr web app repo (http://tumblolr.com).

THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS PROJECT TUMBLOLR.COM HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN. Pixlr decided to remove access to their API, so the site no longer functions correctly. Sorry if you missed it!

This is a web app I made over a weekend to allow people to remix tumblr photo posts. Uses the tumblr API to pull posts, and integrates the (now shutdown) Pixlr API to do the image editing.

The framework used is a custom microframework I wrote specifically for this project just for fun. Not perfect, but I wanted to see what I could come up with in a weekend. The app turned out to be really fun, and the folks over at tumblr liked it but I shut it down when Pixlr removed their API.
